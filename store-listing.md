## Basic Information

### Extension Name
Ollama Bridge

### Summary (132 characters max)
Connect your browser securely to your local Ollama AI models, bypassing mixed content restrictions between HTTPS websites and local HTTP APIs.

### Description
Ollama Bridge creates a secure connection between websites and your local Ollama instance running on your machine. 

This extension solves a common problem: Modern browsers block "mixed content" (HTTPS websites trying to access HTTP resources like your local Ollama API) for security reasons. 

With Ollama Bridge, you can:
- Use your local AI models directly from websites
- Keep your conversations private by using your own models
- Avoid sending data to cloud-based AI services
- Connect to any website that implements the Ollama Bridge protocol
