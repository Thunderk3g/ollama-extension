This extension requires icon files in three sizes:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Icon Design Suggestions

For this extension, consider a design that visually represents:
1. A bridge or connection between two elements
2. The Ollama mascot/logo (the llama)
3. A browser or web element

### Option 3: Use Existing Icons as a Base

You can create a simple placeholder using an open-source icon:

## Save the Icons

Once created, save all three icon files to the `icons/` directory with the exact names:

These files will be referenced in the `manifest.json` file.
